# cleantype_fp: Functional programming style utilities used by cleantype

* fp_base.hpp is inspired by FunctionalPlus (https://github.com/Dobiasd/FunctionalPlus),
  a higly recommendable functional programing library for C++
* fp_show.hpp contains the machinery in order to show the content of variables
  and containers
* fp_tree.hpp contains functions that parse and manipulate trees in a functional way (this is the basis
  of the type parsing in this project)
